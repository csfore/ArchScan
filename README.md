# ArchScan

This program is written with the intentions of providing information whether a package you have installed
shows up in the "Pacman & Package Upgrade Issues" thread on the Arch Forums. Only the most recent posts are checked! (May change)

## Using

For right now, this only works when you run it, I will eventually implement either a cron instance or systemd support.

Please do not rely on this for production environments, it still has false flags for the comparing parts which still need to be worked on.

## Contact

If you wish to contact me, you can reach me via email [contactme@chrisfore.us](emailto:contactme@chrisfore.us)
