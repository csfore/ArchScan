# ArchScan

This program is written with the intentions of providing information whether a package you have installed
shows up in the "Pacman & Package Upgrade Issues" thread on the Arch Forums. Only the most recent packages! (May change)

## Using

For right now, this only works when you run it, I will eventually implement either a cron instance or systemd support.

THIS MAY BE CONVERTED TO A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE IN THE NEAR FUTURE, KEEP THAT IN MIND
